### http://trac.wildfiregames.com/ticket/2495
### This relies on ALL game information is in the state.

I had to redesign the event system of Hannibal and I think I found the source of the problem while looking at AIMetadata. Apparently the bot API holds data, which I consider as game state, but from the view of the game it is AI data. So the real question is: How to serialize the data of the API. There are EntityCollections, MetaData and a few maps. Every JS data structure which survives JSON.stringify() is a non-issue for serialization, so the maps are fine, they also can be easily recreated by the API on load game. Hannibal uses only strings and numbers as MetaData and no ECs. Petra uses ECs and perhaps stores object/array pointers as MetaData, Mimo will know. JS functions can be serialized with .toString(), but not with JSON.stringify() and generator functions coming up with next SM are un-serializable. 

In short Hannibal needs MetaData serialized by the game and Petra ECs and MetaData. Serializing the ECs sounds easy because they rely on entity ids, which don't change and in best case Petra does not save pointers as MetaData. However, Petra is scripted and Hannibal not, there may be more work to make Petra work with saved games. 

A clean solution would probably insist on no data in the API, make AIs serialize their metadata, generate the maps with the engine, replaces the ECs with a triple store running in the engine and encourage AIs to have only object instances re-creatable from JSON. 

The low hanging fruit is to find a solution for the JSON compatible MetaData, which is probably very easy. It would open doors for new bots supporting save/load game and the work on Petra could start too.




### Order process 

Group assets place orders with hcq as filter, location and amount
  order.id is taken from H.Objects
  order.remaining is set to order.amount
  order.processing is set to 0
  order is appended to queue
  queued orders are evaluated every n ticks and 
    if tech is researched 
      order is removed
    if order.remaining == 0 
      order is removed
    if order.remaining + order.processing = order.amount 
      order is ignored
    order.executable is set to false
    if n existing units or structures are available
      they are passed to groups
      order.remaining -= n
    if a producer exists and all requirements are met
      order.producer is selected
      order.executable = true

  executable orders are processed every n ticks 
  first over full amount then on single 
    order.unprocessed = order.remaining - order.processing
    if budget > order.unprocessed.cost
    if budget > order.single.cost
      if unit and producer.queue < 3
        order is passed to producer
        producer.queue += 1
        order.processing += order.unprocessed/single
        producer sends order to engine
      if structure
        producer sends order to engine
        order.processing += order.unprocessed/single

  created foundations, trained units and researched techs appear later in events
  TrainingFinished AIMetadata
    H.Bot.culture.loadById(id);
    H.Economy.listener("onOrderReady", id, event);
      event.metadata.order has order.id
      order.processing -= 1
      order.remaining -= 1
  new researchedTechs
    Events.dispatchEvent("onAdvance", "onAdvance", {name: name, tech: tech});

### Happy Bots Ticket ###

Chatting

* Full communication between teams with bot members
* Synchronize attacks
* Resource sharing, tributes
* Diplomacy between bots

Monte Carlo

Good bots need a lot of testing with different maps. Also bots could learn fom experience, either by the developer adjusting or tweaking params or let a system generate plausible values from played games. 

In artificial intelligence, stochastic programs work by using probabilistic methods to solve problems, as in simulated annealing, stochastic neural networks, stochastic optimization, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming. A problem itself may be stochastic as well, as in planning under uncertainty.

## fun with planning ##

At game start or load a bot is thrown into cold water. He might discover a very hostile environment in terms of resources, units, buildings and enemies. Interestingly game start and end can be very similar, meaning eveything is low, if the human opponnent has victory within his grasp. But a bot doesn't give up, as long there is a small chance of success - he takes it, right?

What is the worst case? Let's say no civic centers. That's close to ground zero in 0 A.D., because without CC you lack the territory to build any other structure. So, naturally the very first questions in this case are: Can I build a CC? And if not, what can I do at all? It turns out, these are very complex questions.

Let's start with some simple conditions:

  has only resources    
    -> whiteflag
  has only buildings    
    -> whiteflag
  has only units    
    -> whiteflag or fight like hell

Ok, that's not so difficult. And it looks translatable into straight forward JavaScript, too. Here comes the next level:

  has buildings, units, no resources
    has no CC
      has no CC builder
        can not train CC builder
          -> whiteflag or fight like hell
        can train CC builder
          -> gather resources
          -> train CC builder
          -> construct CC
      has CC builder
        -> gather resources
        -> construct CC


Actually that's only the surface. It assumes the units are not champions and the needed resources are available. Here are a few more:

  has buildings, resources, no units
    has no CC
      can train CC builder
        -> train CC builder
        -> construct CC
      can not train CC builder
        -> whiteflag

  has units, resources, no buildings
    has no CC
      has no CC builder
        -> whiteflag or fight like hell
      has CC builder
        -> construct CC

and finally:

  has units, resources, buildings
    has no CC
      has CC builder
        -> construct CC
      has no CC builder
        can train CC builder
          -> train builder
          -> construct CC
        can not train CC builder
          -> whiteflag or fight like hell

Can you imagine how many conditions the bot has to check just to find out he has definetly lost? Now add more edge cases, mixin technologies, multiply with all buildings and all factions and you'll end up with tens of thousands lines of code, hard to read, difficult to maintain and taking months to write.

That's where planners jump in. They know which conditions to check and how to answer them. Ontop they come up with a list of actions to reach your goal or none if your goal is unreachable.

HTN (hierarchical task network) planners are conceptually fairly simple, but extremely powerful. They define a state, that's the starting point, a goal and operators and methods, the latter are just functions. Operators can change the state and methods result in more methods or operators. 

So, you initialize a planner with a state, your goal and then call the first method. From there it tries to decompose the problem until only an ordered list of operators is left - that's your plan.

A 0 A.D example:

state = {
  resources: {food: 300, wood: 300},
  entities: {
    structures.athen.civil.centre: 1
    },
  technologies: [phase.village]
};

goal = {
  resources: {},
  entities: {
    structures.athen.field: 1},
  technologies: [gather.wicker.baskets]
}

The goal basically says: I don't care about resources and the civic centre, but in any case I want a field and foragers better equipped. Do you see the two traps? 

Here's the plan:

HTN: SUCCESS, actions: 8, 1 msecs
  op:   1, train_units ( units.athen.support.female.citizen, 1 )
  op:   2, wait_secs ( 10 )
  op:   3, build_structures ( structures.athen.farmstead, 1 )

See how the planner automatically found out he needs a builder for the field and the farmstead for the technology.

And the final state:

resources: { food: 250, wood: 150, time: 195, metal: 0, stone: 0, pop: 1, popmax: 300, popcap: 20 }
entities: {
  structures.athen.civil.centre: 1
  units.athen.support.female.citizen: 1
  structures.athen.farmstead: 1
  structures.athen.field: 1
}
technologies: [phase.village, gather.wicker.baskets]

... which can be used for your next goal. HTN Planners are well used in RTS games. The net has a few nice presentations, google them. Some games have highly optimized ones, checking hundreds of plans each tick, looking for the optimal strategy to keep the human opponent entertained.

So far this planner lacks a few features, he needs a better awareness of time e.g. calculate how long it takes to get a given amount of resources and more challenging learns the concept of parallel tasks.

I'll continue when it produces heros :)

### shared vs. private resources

*  a group can have private or shared resources
*  at game start for all structures => metadata.operator: 'g.custodian'
*  at game start for all units      => metadata.operator: 'none', 'g.healers', 'g.hero'

__group requests private unit: (e.g. grainpicker, female)__
  not existing:
    economy trains unit with metadata.order = order.id
  existing: 
    economy selects unit from game
  on ready economy calls resource listener found in order
  listener sets metadata.operator = instance.id
  listener calls onAssign of group

__group requests shared unit: (hero, healer)__
  not existing:
    economy trains unit with metadata.order = order.id
    on ready :
      economy calls listener for 'g.healer' => assign
        listener sets metadata.operator = instance.id
      economy calls listener for order with ?????
  existing: 
    economy calls listener for order with ?????

__group requests private structure: (e.g. field)__
  not existing:
    economy constructs structure with metadata.order = order.id
    events call on ready in economy
  existing: 
    // do nothing special
  economy calls on ready listener for order
  listener sets metadata.operator = instance.id

__group requests shared structure: (e.g. dropsite, refuge, civic centre)__
  not existing:
    economy constructs structure with metadata.order = order.id
    event onAIMetadata :
      launch instance of 'g.custodian'
      set metadata.operator = instance.id
      assign structure to instance
      connect instance downstream with group
      connect group upstream with instance
      economy calls listener for 'g.healer' => assign
      economy calls listener for order with ?????
  existing: 
    // do nothing special
  economy calls on ready listener for order
  listener sets metadata.operator = instance.id


### HTN Planner ###

design goals: 

*  team-based strategies
*  A plan is a list of ordered of primitive tasks
*  None primitive tasks are compound of subtasks
*  primitive tasks perform (physical) actions directly via their operator
*  methods decompose non prim tasks
*  a prim tasks is achieved by an operator
*  Method decomposition does not change the statte of the world
*  operators have no preconditions only effects
