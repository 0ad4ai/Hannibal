BOTS DON'T CHEAT

Hannibal does not access engine data to find out where your buildings are. He sends out scouts to explore the map and find islands, mines, quarries, food, etc. An internal map is build to keep tracks of buildings and attacks. The basic block of Hannibal are his groups. They all have different goals and can communicate with each other. The difficulty settings control which groups are available during the game and set an upper limit to some buildings. If you are fancy enough and can code JavaScript, you can add your own groups to Hannibal. It is not that difficult as they have a powerful API.

DIFFICULTY SETTINGS

0 : Sandbox

Hannibal will not rush or attack you. It only builds a village, gathers resources and advanves to city phase. If more resources are needed it may expand its territory. However, if *you* attack Hannibal the unit AI will kick in and may shoot arrows or slaughter your units. Also, the towers may be manned. If you kill the scouts exploring the map some more will come. No ships. 

1 : Easy

Same as sandbox, plus walls around villages if possible. Also, Hannibal may build fortress and garrison them.

2 : Medium

Same as easy, but now Hannibal may get active and launch attacks. However, he is not determined to defeat you.

3: Hard

Same as Medium. This is the default settings and you may loose. Hannibal will build two barracks to train recruits and at least one fortresses to buid siege engines.

4: Very Hard

Same as Medium. Three barracks and three fortresses. Groups with champions and heros.

5 : Nightmare

Now Hannibal unleashes all options. Expect multiple and heavy attacks at the same time from different directions, guerilla squads terrorizing your gatherers, early cavalry rushes, war dogs killing your females, targeted attacks on economic installations,
